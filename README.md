📌 Notes & Improvements
Sentences are very short for now; you can customize them easily in the Sentenses list.

Currently, the program checks for an exact match (case and punctuation-sensitive).

No final results popup or restart functionality implemented yet.

Could add difficulty levels, typing speed calculation (WPM), or leaderboards.
